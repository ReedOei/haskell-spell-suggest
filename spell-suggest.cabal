synopsis: spelling suggestion tool. Library and command-line interfaces.
description: 

    "thimk" (an old joke) is a command-line spelling word
    suggestion tool. You give it a possibly-misspelled word,
    and it spits out one or more properly-spelled words in order
    of likelihood of similarity.
    .
    This package is also exported as a library: Text.Spell (suggest)
    .
    There is an optional precompiled SQlite database of phonetic
    codes for the entire dictionary, created with
    "thimk-makedb".  This greatly speeds lookup, permitting
    reasonable performance on enormous dictionaries.
